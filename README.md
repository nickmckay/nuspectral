# nuspectral
This repository contains a compiled version of the *nuspectral* package for the R language, originally written by Adolf Mathias. The method is wavelet-based and closely related to the Weighted Wavelet Z-transform by Foster [1996]. 

Credit for compiling the C portion of the code goes to Matthew Graham (<mjg@caltech.edu>). Wrappers have been developed for spectral analysis by Feng Zhu and Julien Emile-Geay (<julieneg@usc.edu>).

## Installation

To install this package, use the remotes package and this command:
`remotes::install_github("nickmckay/nuspectral")`
