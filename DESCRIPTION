Title: Spectral Transform of Irregularly Sampled Time Series
Version: 1.0
Date: 2018-03-14
Author: Adolf Mathias, Matthew Graham
Description: This package provides several algorithms for the spectral transform of irregularly sampled time series, further a weighted transform that provides a wavelet transform of the input data. For comparison, the Lomb and the Lomb normalized periodogram are added. A C implementation of a divide-and-conquer scheme for the spectral transform of irregularly sampled real data yielding a logarithmically scaled spectrum is also provided.
