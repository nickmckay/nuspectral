Let us reproduce Fig 8 from Mathias et al [2004]
```{r}
library(nuspectral)
load(co2.rda)
t = co2[[2]]
Y = co2[[4]]
omegamax <- 0.0015 
ncoeff <- 100
noctave <- 20
tmin <- 0 
tmax <- 420000 
tsubdiv <- 10000

W = nuspectral::fastnurealwavelet(t,Y,omegamax,ncoeff,noctave,tmin,tmax,tsubdiv) # output is octave*ncoeff*tsubdiv

```
Now what? We need to unwrapped this very large array (305 Mb!!) into a usable form. 




Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
