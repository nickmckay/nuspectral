\title{Algorithm for Spectral Estimation of Irregularly Sampled Data over a Logarithmic
Frequency Range.}
\description{ The function \code{nureal} computes a spectrum of irregularly sampled data. The
resulting coefficients are represented as complex numbers, which stems
from the fact that the accelerated final summation is of complex
nature.
}
\usage{
nureal(X, Y, omegamax, ncoeff, noctave)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{X}{ \code{X} is the ordered sequence of abscissa values. }
  \item{Y}{ \code{Y} is the sequence of corresponding ordinate values. }
  \item{omegamax}{ \code{omegamax} is the top circular frequency for which the spectrum is to be computed. }
  \item{ncoeff}{ \code{ncoeff} is the number of coefficients evenly distributed per octave to be calculated. }
  \item{noctave}{ \code{noctave} is the number of octaves to be calculated. } 
}
\value{An array of spectral coefficients in complex representation.}
